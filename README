# mandatory requirements

- no sideways communication between microfrontends to keep the MFs framework independent

- communication is allowed between container and remotes

- CSS conflicts should not occur, css should be scoped

- version control (monorepo vs non-monorrepo) shouldnt make differnce

- container should be able to decide which version of MF is needed (latest or any specific)

# deployment considerations

1. independent deployment of each module
2. location of remoteEntry.js file must be known at build time since the build of container app has the configuration for remote apps
3. caching issues due to fixed remoteEntry.js
4. need a CI/CD pipeline to solve above 3 points , that deploys individually and links the build output of remotes on the container

## solution to above could be a monorepo, that watches if any change to any module and does a build ONLY if its changed
